# Automated Microscopy Cell Counting using Neural Networks

This repository contains source code  and data submitted as part of the requirements for the degree of BSc (Hons) in Computing for Internet and Multimedia at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, Scotland.

Note that the cell counting artefact is implemented in Google Colab, and requires access to `dataset` and `models` directories in Google Drive.

## Components

- `/log.md`: The project log
- `/CM4105_Cell_Counter.ipynb`: The cell counting artefact
- `/Report/`: The final report
- `/dataset.zip`: The annotated (Version 3) dataset of 20 images (selected from the full Micropics dataset) used in the project
- `/models.zip`: The models produced by each run of training
- `/model_counts.xlsx`: Counts for each model and those from the literature
