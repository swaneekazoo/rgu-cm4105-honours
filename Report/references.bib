abstract = {Suggested by the structure of the visual nervous system, a new algorithm is proposed for pattern recognition. This algorithm can be realized with a multilayered network consisting of neuron-like cells. The network, “neocognitron”, is self-organized by unsupervised learning, and acquires the ability to recognize stimulus patterns according to the differences in their shapes: Any patterns which we human beings judge to be alike are also judged to be of the same category by the neocognitron. The neocognitron recognizes stimulus patterns correctly without being affected by shifts in position or even by considerable distortions in shape of the stimulus patterns.}

abstract = {Restricted Boltzmann machines were developed using binary stochastic hidden units.
These can be generalized by replacing each binary unit by an infinite number of copies
that all have the same weights but have progressively more negative biases. The learning
and inference rules for these "Stepped Sigmoid Units" are unchanged. They can be approximated
efficiently by noisy, rectified linear units. Compared with binary units, these units
learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face
verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. Unlike binary units, rectified
linear units preserve information about relative intensities as information travels
through multiple layers of feature detectors.},
